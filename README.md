# thorsky
Python time-and-the-sky programs built mostly on astropy.

Unlike the deprecated 'pyskycalc3' this has a setup.py file so it can be installed easily.

Contains modules *thorskyutil* and *thorskyclasses3*, which are callable from python2 or python3.  

Also contains a Tkinter GUI script, *pyskcalc3.py*, which is generally similar to the java program JSkyCalc.  This has been adapted to run on both Linux and MacOS.

HTML documentation is included, which was generated by Sphinx from docstrings in the code.

The distribution also includes a jupyter notebook, in two different versions that use python2 or python3-style print statements.
