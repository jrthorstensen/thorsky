# thorsky
Python time-and-the-sky programs built mostly on astropy.  Includes some routines that are lighter-weight and faster than their astropy counterparts while retaining precision adequate for most purposes.

Unlike the deprecated 'pyskycalc3' this has a setup.py file so it can be installed easily. It should suffice to grab the tar.gz file, unpack it, enter the top directory of the package, and install with 'python setup.py install'.

Contains modules *thorskyutil* and *thorskyclasses3*, which are callable from python2 or python3.  

Also contains a Tkinter GUI script, *pyskcalc3.py*, which is generally similar to the java program JSkyCalc.  This has been adapted to run on both Linux and MacOS.

Source codes are posted here for casual browsers.  If you want the package, get the tar.gz file, which has the correct file structure to install properly.

HTML documentation is included in doc/\_build/html. This was generated by Sphinx from docstrings in the code.

The distribution also includes a jupyter notebook, in two different versions that use python2 or python3-style print statements.
